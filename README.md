# Big Data Assignment — Girvan–Newman Algorithm with Node.js

This project creates a network graph, applies **Girvan–Newman** community detection, and visualizes the result **before and after** edge removal.

## Features
- Loads an undirected graph from `samplenetwork.txt`
- Computes **edge betweenness centrality**
- Removes the highest-betweenness edge
- Visualizes two graphs side-by-side using **Sigma.js**

## Requirements
- Node.js (v14+ recommended)
- npm

## Installation
```bash
git clone <repo_url>
cd bigdata-assignment
npm install
